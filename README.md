A react native project, 

To run the app: 

- in the utils folder, go into helpers.js and change the ip to your current ip address - DO NOT CHANGE PORT
- npm start in terminal 
- open a new terminal at the root 
- cd backend
- in backend run nodemon index.js

Thing to bare in mind: 

- The database has 1GB bandwidth limit per day, after this images will not load 
- Sometimes the app may crash when trying to upload an image, if this happens just reload the app and try again
